What can you see here ??

Dataset is preprocessed.
Item based prediction with cosine similarity and euclidean distance as metric.
User based prediction with cosine similarity and euclidean distance as metric.



Sparsity 
The Book crossing dataset is very sparse that it has many null values when we consider for the predictions.
We have reduced the size of the matrix so to reduce the sparsity. But there are other pre processing steps available to reduce the sparcity which people can use.

ANALYSIS
---- Item based gave good results than the user based system.
---- Euclidean Distance is better for this than cosine similarity


Accuracy in which terms?
Simply took an user and predicted the ratings using the model.
Compared it with the actual values.
